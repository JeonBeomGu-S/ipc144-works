## Reflection

- Function: display
- Required Skill: print and align

Milestone 3.3 needs to implement a display function. To implement this function, I need to know how to print. It is very simple. I just need to remind myself how to align the string and numbers. This is an example of how to align.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    double dnum = 1.23456;
    char test[6] = "apple";
    
    // %.2lf means print up to two decimal places
    printf("%.2lf\n", dnum);
    // left-justified 10 spaces
    printf("%-10s\n", test);
    // right-justified 10 spaces
    printf("%10s\n", test);
}
```
