## Reflection

- Function: billDisplay
- Required Skill: cString

Milestone 3.2 needs to implement a billDisplay function. To implement this function, I need to know how to copy the string, so I need to understand the char array. Char array consists of each character and the last element is ‘\0’. The requirement in milestone 3.2 is that I need to print  the first 14 characters in the item name. Therefore, I made a  temp array of size 15. After that, I copied each character from the original name to the temp array, and I changed the last element to ‘\0’. In addition, the ternary operator(?) is optional, but it can simplify the code. This is an example of how to use the ternary operator.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int number = 10;
    int result = 0;
    // 1. if-else
    if (number == 10) {
        result = 1;
    } else {
        result = 0;
    }
    printf("result(if-else): %d\n", result);
    /*
        2. ternary operator
        [condition] ? [result when condition is true] : [result when condition is false]
    */
    result = number == 10 ? 1 : 0;
    printf("result(ternary operator): %d\n", result);
}
```
